# EventCalender
Add event to a specific date. The project is built using php

A calendar that displays the dates for any month between 1990 and 2020. 
Those are  randomly selected years and have no significance—you can make your calendar go from 1980 to 2025 if you want, or any other range of dates that makes sense to you. 
The user can select both month and year with pull-down menus, and the dates for the selected month will be organized according to the days of the week.
In this script, we work with two variables—one for month and one for year—that are supplied by user input. 
These pieces of information are used to build a timestamp based on the first day of the selected month. 
If user input is invalid or absent, the default value is the first day of the  current month.
